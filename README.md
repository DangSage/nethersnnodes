# Nethers & Nodes Game

Nethers & Nodes Game is a fork of Minetest Game, a game for the Minetest engine.
[![Minetest Game ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/shields/title/)](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/)

While Minetest Game aims to be a simple and stable game, Nethers & Nodes Game aims to take MTG's core and add DnD roll mechanics to its base.

Since this Luanti fork aims to provide a simple core to add mods to, it is not intended to be a standalone game.

Minetest Game is in perpetual maintenance-only mode, meaning it will not see new
gameplay features or anything else that breaks compatibility (see
[#2710](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/issues/2710)).

## Compatibility
